[![Development notes are in the wiki](https://img.shields.io/badge/notes-in%20wiki-success)](../../wiki/notes)

This repository contains code to support running filesystem benchmarks on the PRP's Nautilus cluster and on the NAS Division's HPC environment.

See [`PRP/`](PRP/) and [`NAS/`](NAS/) respectively for system-specific files and readmes.

## Acknowledgements
This work was conducted as part of a joint-internship between the [Universities Space Research Association (USRA)](https://www.usra.edu/), the High-End Computing program of the [NASA Advanced Supercomputing Division (NAS)](https://www.nas.nasa.gov/hecc/), and the [Pacific Research Platform (PRP)](https://nationalresearchplatform.org/prp/).

A great deal of thanks are in order:
- To USRA and NASA mentors Dr. Henry Jin, Dr. Aaron Lott, and Dr. David Bell for helping me grow comfortable in the NASA computing environment and driving my research questions further and deeper.
- To UCSD and PRP staff John Graham, Dima Mishin, and Jon Paden for introducing me to the field of HPC and providing the foundations on which my research was based on.
- To researchers Dr. Milad Memarzadeh (USRA, NASA), Dr. Ata Asanjan (USRA), Dr. Apoorva Shastry (USRA, USGS) for providing me with an understanding of representative NASA-level research and providing ML code to test the systems against.
- To benchmark expert Dr. Glenn Lockwood (NERSC) for sitting down to chat with me about fundamentals and pitfalls of I/O benchmarking and paving the way for the suites of tests I ran.
