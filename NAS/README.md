NAS HECC
========

The NAS High-End Computing Capability (HECC) Project uses an [HPC environment with a separate front-end and compute nodes](https://www.nas.nasa.gov/hecc/support/kb/hpc-environment-overview_25.html). The process to run a benchmark is the following:
1. Create a Python virtualenv with software dependencies
2. Create a script to run the benchmark
3. Submit the benchmark script as a batch job using the Portable Batch System (PBS)

There are multiple supercomputers within the NAS HPC environment. For now, only **Pleiades** is being explored.

You will need to have an NAS account and have access to the secure enclave to do anything. See https://www.nas.nasa.gov/hecc/support/kb/
